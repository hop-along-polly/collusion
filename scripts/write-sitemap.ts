/**
 * Writes `dist/sitemap.xml` from the catalog and the notes on disk, so the file cannot
 * list a page that does not exist or miss one that does.
 *
 * It matters more than it looks. Until the Cloudflare Worker started correcting the
 * status, every route except `/` answered 404 and nothing but the homepage could be
 * indexed. With that fixed there are 35 indexable pages and no external links to most of
 * them, so a sitemap is how a crawler finds them at all.
 *
 * `SITE_URL` overrides the origin, for a fork or a staging host. `BASE_PATH` is read the
 * same way `vite.config.ts` reads it, so a deployment under a project path stays correct.
